Redpanda Cloud has done it again—we’ve achieved SOC 2 certification! 

Our auditors, Barr Advisory, found no exceptions. The audit scope included all Redpanda Cloud products: BYOC, Dedicated, and Serverless; and across all three cloud providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure.

As Andrea Fossati, our Governance, Risk and Compliance Program manager, stated,

“This is further testament of our commitment to serve our customers by providing them with a secure platform developed by an organization with a robust security posture.”
This milestone is more than just a badge. By renewing our SOC 2 certification, we’re not just meeting industry standards—we’re exceeding them, ensuring that your data is protected with the highest care and diligence. This lets you focus on your business with complete peace of mind that your data is in the safest hands (or paws). 

But the path to compliance can be bumpy. So, at Redpanda, we follow a few specific ingredients for success. In this post, we’ll share our “4 C’s of compliance” and end with a note on how you can peruse our latest SOC 2 audit report.


The 4 C’s of compliance #
Controls
SOC stands for System and Organization Controls. It's well understood that controls are at the heart of compliance. The interesting part is that SOC 2 ensures you have policies outlining specific controls and evidence to show those controls are designed, implemented, and operated effectively. What it doesn’t do, however, is speak to the quality of policies and controls. 

That’s why it's often difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison between SOC 2 reports from competing vendors. As an organization, you must implement systems, procedures, and practices that manage risks and ensure compliance.

Consistency
Compliance is about adhering to laws, regulations, standards, and internal policies to ensure legal and ethical conduct within an organization. 

The reality of how that comes about is through consistency. It requires people to consistently apply processes, controls, and policies throughout the organization. Consistent execution across access management, vulnerability management, and systems monitoring (to mention a few) are key to a successful SOC 2 audit. 

Culture
We’ve talked about having good controls applied consistently — but without the culture to enforce them, they become meaningless. Fostering an environment where compliance is valued and ethical behavior is encouraged and practiced at all levels ultimately spells success in compliance for an organization. 

Many compliance tasks are routine and time-consuming. They also seem to pop up at the most inopportune moments. However, every last one of those tasks matters, and the results speak for themselves through audits like SOC 2.

Commitment
This last one is why our recent SOC 2 certification is special for the Redpanda team. It’s a reaffirmation of our unwavering commitment to secure your data and trust. This commitment is made by the entire organization, day-to-day and continuously, by prioritizing top-tier security and compliance efforts. Frankly, you simply can’t achieve compliance without commitment. 

“Compliance is a tricky business. Unlike shipping a new feature or signing a contract, success is rarely observed in big, notable work. Instead, it's reflected in the day-in, day-out commitment throughout the organization.” - Todd Farmer, Director of Program Management at Redpanda.
